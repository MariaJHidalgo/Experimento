|5|**Signal coherence of the resting-state functional BOLD signal from each individual functional unit**|Metrics based in connectivity matrices|standard deviation (STDi) of the average signals combined from individual vertices in each functional unit i (i = 1, 2, . . . , 300). Due to normalization, the STD of each signal from the vertices is equal to one, such that the STDi of the combined signal represents the coherence of the individual signals in the ROI| <li> STD = 1  signals from vertices are coherent <br> <li> STD = 0 if there is no correlation between signals from vertices<br>|https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11121565|

|10|**Synthetic Complete Deletion of Brain Macroregions**|Metrics based in connectivity matrices|Allows to quantify the impact that the connectivity of each macroregion has on the prediction of the behavior. It is done by simulated synthetic deletions of macroregions and then recalculation of new connectivity matrices in their absence. An index ρ represents the performance ratio between each synthetic network with macroregion i absent and the actual network (where all macroregions were present)|<li> ρi < 1 : Constructive role of themacroregion i. The connectivity matrix with deleted i performed worse compared to when it was not deleted, therefore, the connectivity of themacroregion i to the rest of the brain had a constructive role in predicting the behavior. <br> <li> ρi ≈ 1 : Irrelevant role of macroregion i. The connectivity matrix with deleted i had almost the same performance compared to when it was not deleted, therefore the connectivity of the i macroregion had an irrelevant role in predicting the behavior.<br>|https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.889725|

|12|**Clustering coefficient or cliquishness**|Graph theory|Assesses the tendency for any two neighbours of a vertex to be directly connected (or more strongly connected in the weighted case) to each other|PENDIENTE|https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-021-02435-0|
